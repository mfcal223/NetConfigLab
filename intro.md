## 1. 📝 Project Overview and Objectives

In this document, we will gather information to complete exercises designed to help students understand and apply core networking principles in a simulated environment.

There will be exercises to fix a non-functioning network. The goal will be **solving the network problems** by **modifying IP configurations** until the network works.

For copyright restrictions we cannot show the tool we were provided to practice. But there are several other tools online that can be used to practice with similar exercises: 

1. Cisco Packet Tracer (Free for students)  
🔧 Graphical drag-and-drop network simulation  
✅ Realistic device configuration (routers, switches, PCs)  
🧠 Teaches subnetting, IP configuration, routing  
🎓 Requires creating a **free** Cisco Networking Academy account  
🔗 https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer  

2. Boson NetSim (Paid, free trial available)  
🖥️ Professional-grade simulator (for Cisco exams)  
💡 Lets you practice exact router and switch commands  
💰 More advanced than NetPractice, but excellent for real-world command-line training

3. GNS3 (Graphical Network Simulator)  
⚙️ Realistic, open-source simulator (must install locally)  
🌐 Can simulate real operating systems like Cisco IOS or Linux VMs  
🔧 Very advanced, but powerful if you want to learn deeply

4. Subnetting Practice Sites  
If your main goal is just IP addressing + subnet mask calculations, try:  
🔢 https://subnettingpractice.com/ (drills and quizzes)   
🧠 https://www.davidbombal.com/subnetting-quiz/  
🧮 https://www.practice-subnetting.com/  

5. NetDevGroup's NDG NetLab+ (used in some schools)  
🌍 Web-based labs with actual VMs  
🧰 Used in training institutions and Cisco academies  
📋 ***You’d need school or institutional access !!!!! ***

## 2. 🧭 How the NetConfigLab Project Works

🧩 Ideally, you should use a Interface-based, no real network tool, that will provide:  
- A visual of a broken network.  
- A goal (fix the connectivity issue).  
- Editable **unshaded fields** (IP addresses, subnet masks, etc.).  
- **“Check again”** button to validate configuration.  
- **“Get my config”** to export solution.  
- Logs to help identify errors.  
- After fixing each level, **export the configuration**  

> 🧠 this can be use for evaluation/examination purposes.
